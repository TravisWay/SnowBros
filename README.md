## Midterm project for Skill Distillery

## TEAM: andyWynyard charlieactor TravisWay Maldojavadev1969

**Problem:** Heading to the ski field is a fun, but often expensive undertaking. One of the best things about going skiing is meeting new friends with similar interests to you. Along the same vein as UBER and LYFT, this application lets users create trips to ski fields (or wherever actually) and other users can join the trip to share the costs of the journey.

**Methodologies:** For the most part the team worked independently. However, we operated within Agile as much as we could. This included morning stand-ups (sometimes sat down if there was more to cover), and following along with strict sprints.

**Technologies used within this project:**
* SpringMVC
* JPA
* Google Maps API
* JPQL
*

**Implementation**
To replicate this application, you will need a deployable platform (AWS) and Spring to design everything. You will need to create a JPA project with entities, and then move to a new MVC project once that is functional.
