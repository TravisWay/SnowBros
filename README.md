## Midterm project for Skill Distillery

## TEAM: charlieactor TravisWay Maldojavadev1969

This web application is a solution to filling seats in your car for a skiing trip. Often, people are willing to go skiing, but do not have a car, and others have spots to offer. We wanted to connect these two groups of individuals, in a similar way that ride sharing apps connect people.

Technologies used within this project:
* SpringMVC
* JPA
